                <p><img src="../images/ryzen.png" alt="CPU" class="img"></p>
                <p>-core, 32 AMD's new Zen 4 flagship, the Ryzen 9 7950X is a 16
                    thread CPU that clocks between 4.5 GHz and 5.7 GHz depending on the load.The Ryzen 9 7950X is set 
                    to replace the well-regarded 5950X, but quite surprisingly the launch price or MSRP has been dropped 
                    from $800 the previous generation to $700 for the 7950X -- that's a healthy 13% discount for 
                    what should be a much faster processor.</p>
                <h3>Clock Speeds</h3>
                <p><img src="../images/ryzen2.jpg" alt="" class="img"></p>
                <p>Source Techspot
                    For single core workloads the 7950X appeared to maintain a clock frequency of 5.725 GHz, or 25 MHz above the advertised clock frequency. 
                    The maximum reported frequency was 5.85 GHz, though this didn't appear to be achieved under load.
                    </p>
                <p>Conclusion:
                    The Ryzen 9 7950X is an impressive kit of hardware, it's the ultimate no compromise solution and it's hands down the best at what it does.it’s
                    a great CPU for people who wants the ultimate performance for productivity and gaming Our recommendation is:
                    IF You are building a new PC from scratch and want a beast for high end productivity while also having your gaming 
                    performance in check the Ryzen 9 7950x is a great choice.But if you only care about gaming performance there are 
                    better products that are much cheaper and provide similar gaming performance like Ryzen 7 7700x or Ryzen 5/core i5 parts.
                    Or if you are on an Am4 and have a ryzen 5 3600x upgrading to ryzen 7 5800X3D is a much better solution.

                <h3><a href="#CPU" class="link">Intel Core i7-13700K Review</a></h3>
                <p><img src="../images/intel.png" alt="CPU" class="img"></p>
                <h3>Clock Speed</h3>
                <p><img src="../images/intel2.jpg" alt="" class="img"></p>
                <p>Before we dive into the blue bar graphs, here's a look at clock behavior in Cinebench R23. After an hour of load 
                    testing the 13700K maintained an all-core frequency of 5.2 GHz for the P-cores and 4.1GHz for the E-cores. 
                    This frequency was sustained using the MSI CoreLiquid S360 360mm AIO installed inside the MSI Prospect 700Rcase
                    </p>
                <p>Conclusion:
                    The 13700K is a very good CPU provides a decent productivity and gaming performance while being more manageable than the 13900K
                    IF you have a 12th gen Motherbored and you want and an Upgrade then the 13700K is a very great deal but if you are building your 
                    system from scratch then the AMD is also very compiling since the AM5 Support continuing to 2025 but Intel 13th gen is the last on LGA 1700

                <p>Clock Speeds
                    Before we get into the blue bar graphs, here's a look at the all-core behavior in Cinebench R23, starting with the 7600. By default it runs at a 
                    core power of 65w with a package power of 90 watts and this allows for a typical all-core clock frequency of 4920 MHz. Using the be quiet! Pure Loop 
                    2 FX 360mm liquid cooler we saw a peak die temperature of 78c.click Auto OC or PBO option enabled, the typical operating frequency for this workload 
                    only jumped up to 4995 MHz, a mere 75 MHz bump.This did increase the core power to 75 watts and the package power to 102 watts for a peak operating 
                    temperature of 83c.
                </p>
                <p><img src="../images/clock ryz7.jpg" class="img"></p>
                <p>Next we have the Ryzen 7 7700 which runs at 4880 MHz out of the box in this workload, resulting in a package power of 90w and an operating temperature of 
                    67c. With PBO enabled the frequency jumped up by 3.5% to 5050 MHz and this modest frequency gain increased power usage by a massive 39% to 125 watts which 
                    also drastically increased the operating temperature to 87c. 
                    That's quite tame when compared to the 7700X which clocks just 5% higher than the stock 7700 for an almost 60% increase in power usage, hitting 98c.</p>
                <p>Conclusion:
                    What's clear is that AMD Zen 4's position has been strengthened since our launch reviews. The more affordable 65w parts are also more sensible out of the box,
                    and with much more affordable B650 motherboards it means the platform is now viable and in our opinion the obvious choice over AM4 for new system builders, 
                    outside of budget builds. This was already true before the arrival of these non-X 65w parts as AMD had cut pricing aggressively over the past few months, but 
                    the new CPUs make it all official. There's a chance the original X-parts head back towards their respective MSRPs (and become more expensive), but at that point 
                    we'd simply ignore them and just go for the non-X 65w models instead.
